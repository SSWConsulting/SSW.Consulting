As per our Sprint Planning Meeting, and as the Product Owner, you have agreed to the following Product Backlog Items (PBIs) being included in the current sprint backlog.
 
The Team will do its best to deliver this set of features (Scope), to a defined quality standard (Definition of Done) by the end of the sprint. Ideally the team will deliver what they forecast, or even a bit more, but this can't be guaranteed.
