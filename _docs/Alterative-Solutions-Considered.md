## Explains other options that were discounted.

### For example:

- We chose to use a code-centric .NET solution over a low code solution because we did not want to be locked into any specific vendor e.g. Dynamics, Outsystems.
- We chose to use Angular over React because 5/6 developers on the project were more familiar with Angular.
- We chose to use Azure over on-premises to avoid procurement of costly servers.
- Note: If you decide that after the fact that the chosen solution is wrong, this should be explained. Include what led to the current circumstances and if there is a planned change.
