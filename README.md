# SSW Rewards Mobile App!

This is a .NET MAUI app with a .NET 8 backend.

Use this app to scan SSW QR codes, earn SSW Points ‚≠ê, claim rewards and win prizes!

## .NET MAUI migration
App was upgraded from Xamarin.Forms to .NET MAUI, using initially the .NET Migration assistant (using the .NET CLI) to produce a reference project, but then most of the work was done manually. You can see the resulting PR, which shows all the changes from the previous Xamarin.Forms version, to the .NET MAUI version here: https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rewards.Mobile/pull/451.
